## Description
The player is randomly given 15 cards: 5 warriors, 5 wizards, and 5 archers. Out of these 15 cards, he must choose 10. He is also randomly given 5 items: amulet, poison, curse, elixir. Each item can be used to heal, strengthen, or suppress any of the cards only once. Next, a computer is put to play against the player, who will also have 10 cards and 5 items.
There are three types of characters in the game: one type of melee characters and two types of ranged characters. Some characters have special abilities.
The course of the game:
Gamer_1 walks, chooses a card or an object, which he will use in this turn and acts. 
Player_2 does the same. 
The team that loses is the one that is left without combat-ready cards (all are dead).
