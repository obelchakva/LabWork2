Each item can be used to heal, strengthen, or suppress any of the cards only once. 
Next, a computer is put to play against the player, who will also have 6 playing cards, but no items.
There are three types of characters in the game: one type of melee characters and two types of ranged characters. Some characters have special abilities.

Gamer walks, chooses a card, which he will use in this turn and acts.
Then Gamer chooses if he want to use an item.
