# General
My game is as simple as possible and is designed for single player play against the computer.
The gameplay takes place in the console.
There is a choice of actions with the output of all necessary information.

### Gameplay
The player is randomly given 6 cards: 
- 2 from class Voin (Pehota, Vor, Berserk or Paladin); 
- 2 from class Luchnick (Strelok, Eger, Antimag or Assasin); 
- 2 from class Mag (Celitel, Zaclinatel, Arhimag or Illuzionist); 
There are 4 characters in each class. Almost all of them have unique abilities. You can find them in the class description table.
He is also randomly given 2 of 4 items: 
- amulet; 
- poison; 
- curse;
- elixir; 
You can also see the effect of the items in the table.
Each item can be used to heal, strengthen, or suppress any of the cards only once.
Next, a computer is put to play against the player, who will also have 6 playing cards, but no items.
Gamer walks, chooses a card, which he will use in this turn and acts. 
Then Gamer chooses if he want to use an item. 
Computer walks, randomly chooses a card, which he will use in this turn and acts. 
The team that loses is the one that is left without combat-ready cards (all are dead).

### Tips
- It is important to remember that melee warriors cannot attack ranged warriors. 
If such an attack is attempted, the turn will pass to the opponent!
- Do not try to attack dead opponents, otherwise you risk losing your turn!
