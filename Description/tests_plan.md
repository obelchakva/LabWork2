# Plan of the tests
1. Initialization test
2. Test of the "attack" function
3. Test of the "attack" function with invalid conditions
All these tests are conducted sequentially for each of the classes. 
The "attack" function is checked on the class "Pehota", 
which can be attacked by any of the classes 
(there is no unsuccessful attack due to distance)
